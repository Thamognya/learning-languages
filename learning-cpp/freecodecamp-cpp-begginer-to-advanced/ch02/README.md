# Compiler errors

## compile time errors

Errors that occur at compile time. Like missing semicolons, missing closing brackets, and etc. You have to fix the error before compiling again.

check [compile.cpp](./errors/compile.cpp)

## run time errors

check [runtime.cpp](./errors/runtime.cpp)

Errors that occur at run time. They can compile properly, but can not run properly. You have to fix the error, recompile and then run again. They can cause the problem to crash.

## warnings

check [warning.cpp](./errors/warning.cpp)

Errors that are not enough to stop the compiler from compiling, but are enough to stop the program to run (under some circumstances).
